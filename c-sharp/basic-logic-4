/* 1-The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...
     The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.Ex.:The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
     Knowing the informations above, write a program that calculates and shows the sequence to the 20th number.
