//Aggregation part 2
/*
â€¢Aggregation: it's a special kind of classes relationship.Example(based on the previous exercise):
 w[0] = new Warrior("Ninja", "Japan", 31, 1.75f, 68.9f, 11, 2, 1); //Warrior 1
 w[1] = new Warrior("Capoeira", "Brazil", 29, 1.68f, 57.8f, 14, 2, 3); //Warrior 2
-We need to create a class to make them fight.The class is called "Fight":
 -Class: Fight
 -Attributes(- is private ): 
  -adversary(who was challenged): abstract 
  -challenger(who asked for a fight): abstract
  -rounds: int
  -fightApproved: bool //Show if this fights is according with the tournament rules(see it below)
 -Methods:
  +ArrangeFight()
  +FightNow()
  setters/getters
  
  -The aggregation is represented in uml by an arrow with the diamond geometrical shape as tip:
             (-->Warrior(s) disputes one(or more) Fight(s)-->)    
   Warrior ---------------------------------------------------<> Fight
                (<--a Fight is disputed by Warrior(s)<--)
   i.e. class B(Fight) has one (or more) attributes from class A(Warrior).This is aggregation.
   
   -Tournament rules:
    1-Fights can only be arranged by Warrior from the same category
    2-Challenger and adversary must be different
    3-Fight should only be started if it's approved
    4-Fight result can only be: one warrior won or the fight drew

//Now, we're going to create our class Fight:

class Fight

 //Attributes
 private

 private int rounds;

 //Methods
 public void ArrangeFight(w[0], w[1])
 {
  if(w[0].WarriorClass == w[1].WarriorClass && w[0] != w[1])

   fightApproved = true;

   challenger = w[1];
  }else{
   fightApproved = false;
   adversary = null;
   challenger = null;
  }  
 }
 public void FightNow()
 {
  if(fightApproved == true)
  {
   adversary.Announcement();
   challenger.Announcement();
   //Main class have this: 
   //Random random = new Random();
   int winner = random.Next(0, 3);//3 is not included - 0 is draw, 1 adversary wins and 2 chalenger wins
   switch(winner)
   {
    case 1:
     Console.WriteLine("Draw");
     break;
    case 2:
     Console.WriteLine("Adversary win.");
     break;
    case 3:
     Console.WriteLine("Challenger win.");
     break;
   }
   
  }else{
   Console.WriteLine("This fight cannot happen!!!");
  }
  
 }
 //Setters and Getters
 public Warrior
 {

 public Warrior

 public int Rounds
 {
  get{return rounds;}
  set{rounds = value;}

 public bool FightApproved
