/*
â€¢UML Inheritance Tree:

      |--AC <------ ACA
 A <-----AA <------ AAA
(Root)|--AB <------ ABA <----- ABAA 
                           |-- ABAB
                               (Leaves(Leaf))

Note: In the example above, the Root of the tree (A) is a class that doesn't have any mother class (or superclass) above it
and the Leaves(leaf)(ABAA and ABAB) are the classes that dont't have daughter classes(or sub classes)
