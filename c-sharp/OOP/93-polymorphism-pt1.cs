/*
•Polymorphism: word that comes from Greek language (Poly = "many, much", Morphos = "shape, form") meaning 
 "something that can have multiple shapes/forms and/or behaviors".
 
 •Method signature: 
  -Every method can or cannot receive arguments(parameters). The quantity and types of it's arguments will define
  it's signature.
  -Every method has it own signature.
  
   -Example: 
   -public void calculateGPA(float n1, float n2)
    {
     ...
     return float x;
    }
    
   -public void calculateGPA(float v1, float v2)
    {
     ...
     return int y;
    }
    
   -Despite of the arguments (float n1, float n2 / float v1, float v2) in the two methods having different names, their types(float, float)
   and quantity(2 in the first method and 2 in the second method) are the same, making the signature in both methods the same.
     
   -public void calculateGPA(int term, float n1, float n2)
   {
    ...
   }
   -The method above have 3 arguments(term, n1, n2) and 3 types (int, float, float) and it is different from the two mthods above.
