/*Visibility: indicates the level of access of the class' internal components (methods and attributes), i.e., how this items
 can be accessed.
 
 Using UML, we can set a visual class diagram to be easy to represent the class and it's visibility:
 Example:
  ------------
  |Pen        | Class name
  ------------  
  |model      | Attributes
  |color      |
  |tipSize    |
  |penLoad    |
  |lid        |
  -------------
  |write()    | Methods
  |scribble() |
  |paint()    |
  |lidOn()    |
  |lidOff()   |
  -------------
